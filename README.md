Gift giving is a wonderful way to show appreciation, celebrate milestones, and strengthen relationships. However, it can be a time-consuming and stressful process, especially when trying to find the perfect gift for someone. To address this problem, we are developing a web app that streamlines the process of gift giving.

The web app will provide a user-friendly interface that guides users through the entire gift-giving process, from selecting the recipient to purchasing and delivering the gift. Users will start by creating a profile, which includes information about their gift preferences, budget, and occasions they typically celebrate.
